# Getting Started

Welcome to the new Workday Integration happening school wide at BYUH. The following documentation seeks to provide a facilitated outline and plan on assisting those within the department at navigating through and finding items that were previously accessible on PeopleSoft software.

The new Workday integration seeks to create a unified campus-wide system, where campus is no longer divided among many different softwares but one single integrated system.
